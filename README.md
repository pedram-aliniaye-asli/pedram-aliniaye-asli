- 👋 Hi, I’m Pedram
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming.
- 🌱 I have done so many different projects, and always used Github as a place to share and contribute to coding. But now I want to have a clean and neat project's show place here!!
- 💞️ I’m mostly interested in Web development (e.g. Django), Data Science Applications, and Machine Learning projects.
- 📫 You can contact me here in Github or in Linkedin: linkedin[dot]com/in/pedramaliniayeasli/
